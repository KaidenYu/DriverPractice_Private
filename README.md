This is reference from [動手寫 Linux Driver](http://blog.logan.tw/2013/01/linux-driver.html)

## Environment Preparation

You may use Git to clone the repository, toolchain to build the codes.

If you develope for the embedded system, you may need the Device Tree Compiler (DTC).

### Archlinux

1. Install development tools
	```sh
	pacman -S git
	pacman -S make gcc
	```

2. Install the Linux kernel headers.  It depends on the environment.

	* x86 series ``` pacman -S linux-headers ```

	* ARMv7 series ``` linux-armv7-headers ```
	
	* Even by the board ...


3. Install the Device Tree Compiler (DTC)
	```sh
	pacman -S dtc
	```
